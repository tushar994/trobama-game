# trobama game

This is a very simple game
You are a child, full of wonder and curiousity, trying to navigate the world, 
in a search for a beautiful life.
But, politicians, with their ugly face and voices, and with all the candy in 
the world, are trying to take away your wonder for the world. Them!! with their 
smelly faces, pretty (and fast) candy, and ugly music, will try to stop you.
Avoid them!! Gain points, and have a great time!!
This is a two player game.


**Controls**

player one - arrow keys
player two - wasd keys
Pause - P

**point system**

You get higher points, 
The lesser the time you take,
The harder the level is (level automatically increases as you progress)
in the first level, getting past a candy(moving object) gives you 10 points
and getting past a politician gives you 5 points.
as you progress, you get more points for crossing each obstacle

#starting screen

This scree shows the results of the previous game.
If the game has been freshly opened, it shows zero points for each player,
and says that it's a draw

#swapping between players

Whenever a player loses a life, or crosses a level, the players swap, This 
is better than another way, in which players switch only when the first player 
loses all his lives,as in this way, everyone stays stuck to the game(unless 
they die :| )
